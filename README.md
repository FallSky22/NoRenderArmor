# NoRenderArmor
Just some PNG images for NoRender(ing) out diamond armor (for a resource pack). Using both diamond_layer_1 and diamond_layer_2. It just makes the armor look like that "invisible" armor or whatever.
The PNG images were destracted from a 1.12.2 cpvp resource pack called: BrownZombiePack edit. The credits go to the maker BrownZombie for making the resource pack. 
I wanted to destract the PNG images because for working on a different resource pack project or whatever. 
If you are interested in the 1.12.2 cpvp resource pack, here is a available link: https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/brownzombie-crystal-pvp-texture-pack-1-12-2/
